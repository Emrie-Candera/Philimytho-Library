This is made just from pure hobby-level interest in [Philippine Mythology](Philippine%20Mythology.md) and [Philippine Folklore](Philippine%20Folklore.md). 

How this vault classified the different aspects of Philippine folklore is a mixture of my preferences as well as previous attempts of categorizations. I'll expand more on the specific bases for such decisions for every major category in the "Classification" note in each folder. 
### Bestiary
At the moment, the creatures are divided into two main categories: [Lower Mythology](../Bestiary/Lower%20Mythology/'Main%20Note.md) and [Higher Mythology](Higher%20Mythology.md). I intentionally kept them broad because between the many taxonomic attempts, I am unsure how *I* would personally classify them into yet. 

However, you can view the creatures classified by previous taxonomic attempts created by:
* [Maximo Ramos](../Bestiary/Classifications/Ramos%20Taxonomy/'Main%20Note.md)
* [Edgar Calabia Samar](../Bestiary/Classifications/Samar%20Taxonomy/'Main%20Note.md)
